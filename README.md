# NixOS X-Plane 11 FHS environment

X-Plane 11 does not run ntively on NixOS. To get it working we have to create a FHS complinet environment with all required dependencies.

## How does it work

1. Checkout this repo and enter the directory
2. Run `nix profile install`
3. Start the installer / launcher with `X-Plane-11`
