# NixOS X-Plane 11 FHS environment

X-Plane 11 does not run ntively on NixOS. To get it working we have to create a FHS complinet environment with all required dependencies.

## How does it work

1. Checkout this repo and enter the directory
2. Download the **X-Plane 11** installer
3. Enter the FHS environment by running `nix develop`
4. Execute the installer `./X-Plane 11 Installer Linux`
